# Data Storytelling with SQL and Python

## Overview:
This portfolio showcases my ability to establish secure connections with Oracle Autonomous Databases using Visual Studio Code and Oracle SQL Developer, as well as my foundational work in data querying and initial analysis. Each section represents practical steps taken to build, organize, and test data workflows.

## Current Portfolio:

1. **.gitignore Setup**:  
   Implemented `.gitignore` to streamline version control by excluding unnecessary files, like virtual environments and sensitive configuration files.

2. **Database Connection**:  
   Successfully connected to Oracle Autonomous Database via Python (`oracledb` library) and tested query execution using secure credential handling with a `config.ini` file.

3. **Organized Python and SQL Scripts**:  
   Structured essential scripts to manage database queries and interactions, using both Oracle SQL and Python for efficient data retrieval.
