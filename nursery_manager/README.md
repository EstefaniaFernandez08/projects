# Golden Roots Nursery Datacenter

## Community-led nursery in Barranquilla, Colombia: Data management project for tropical dry forest restoration.

This is a data-driven management system for a non-profit plant nursery to restore 3.3 ha of tropical dry forest in an urban area. Aiming to centralize and automate data input, management, and reporting, the core of the system is a relational database designed to track species, batches, and all related care activities, enabling efficient monitoring and decision-making.

What you will find here:

* Table arquitecture and data collection over time.
* Workflow and automation design for collaborative data input.
* Nursery data visualization and periodical reporting.

## Next steps (Work in progress!)
1. Separated refined Jupyter notebooks for data collection.
2. Automate a Python application for collaborative input data.
3. Reusable and incrementally refine reports for periodic data visualization.
